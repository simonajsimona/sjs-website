I will use the R statistical programming language through RStudio in this process. It is important that you install R and RStudio on your machine, including all the accompanying packages specified here. Get documentation providing installation guides for both R and RStudio here. We are going to use the RStudio environment for our data collection but of course it will not work properly if you haven’t installed R first as he installation document explains. Assuming everything is set, we will need the following suite of packages. We might as well begin by installing them.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;twitteR\u0026quot;) # As the name indicate, it is used for capturing data from twitter install.packages(\u0026quot;ROAuth\u0026quot;) # You need to be authorised to get data from twitter, this package will serve that purpose install.packages(\u0026quot;httr\u0026quot;) # For requesting data from APIs install.packages(\u0026quot;rtweet\u0026quot;) # Another package we use to get data from twitter and analyse it library(twitteR) library(ROAuth) library(httr) library(rtweet) After we are done with the packages, we will need credentials authorising us to access twitter data. It is important for us to have credentials so that twitter can control how much information we are gathering and that we do not abuse the platform. To do that, we need to create an app on the twitter developer site and we will use this app to call the twitter API. Click here to access the website or you can just Google twitter developer platform or any combination of words which have the words twitter and developer next to each other. We need to have a twitter for us to do this, which I assume we already have, otherwise why would we need to extract data from a community we don’t belong to. On the developer platform, we will create a developer account (yes it is different from your main twitter account). Twitter will ask for your mobile number here. It is important for you to supply the correct number because they will use it for authentication. Click on the ‘Create New App’ once you sign in. It is located on the top right corner of the screen. Name and describe the app as you wish. The instructions are pretty straightforward. Some fields are mandatory. You will be requested to provide a website and callback URLs. You can provide your own website if you have one. Any website should suffice here. The callback URLs are not mandatory – you can leave them blank.\nAfter the app is created, it will appear on your screen and you should be able to click on the ‘details’ button, to get a page that looks like a picture below. You can see the name of my app, description, my website URL and callback URL as indicated above. On the ‘keys and tokens’ tab, you will find the credentials that are needed for you to be authorised to collect data on twitter. I have chosen not to show that tab here because it contains my own credentials and I didn’t want them exposed to anybody who reads this post. You also need to keep yours confidential because anyone can (mis)use them if they are exposed. They include API key, API secret key, Access token and Access token secret.\nTwitter developer app page.\n Now that we have our credentials in the bag, there are basically two packages in R (at least those I know of this far) we can use to harvest data from twitter: the rtweet package by Michael Kearney and the twitteR package by Jeff Gentry. Either should do the job perfectly well. I have included the procedure for both just in case one of them gives you problems. It is certainly not uncommon for packages to give you a few glitches here and there even if you are an experienced user.\nFor the rtweet package, we need to copy the credentials and put then in the create_token function in R. Please note that the credentials I am using here are only for illustrative purposes. But your credentials should look more or less like them.\ntoken \u0026lt;- create_token( app = \u0026quot;simona_app\u0026quot;, consumer_key = \u0026quot;VocbltyHiK5F2VHnC4jRpmaT8\u0026quot;, consumer_secret = \u0026quot;wrwVFnoaRXZUYsCfrOJvEgUcZmKLsHasPQjVgz6HJHlTaDeM7uRl\u0026quot;, access_token = \u0026quot;786205049854307650-BvJaX0YUfVtDzOwfAslGyxRhr43Y9M\u0026quot;, access_secret = \u0026quot;y5Dxe9YsCOLKdCTOyRW6btR5KyTAHlssEN3WFSBvGjYtu\u0026quot;) For the twitteR package, you just need the keys to be in the following format. The exact wording of the access token shouldn’t matter much.\napi_key \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;VocbltyHiK5F2VHnC4jRpmaT8\u0026quot; api_secret \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;wrwVFnoaRXZUYsCfrOJvEgUcZmKLsHasPQjVgz6HJHlTaDeM7uRl\u0026quot; access_token \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;786205049854307650-BvJaX0YUfVtDzOwfAslGyxRhr43Y9M\u0026quot; access_token_secret \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;y5Dxe9YsCOLKdCTOyRW6btR5KyTAHlssEN3WFSBvGjYtu\u0026quot; setup_twitter_oauth(api_key, api_secret, access_token, access_token_secret) Assuming I want to examine gender-based violence discourses in virtual spaces and I want to collect 5000 tweets which make reference to gender-based violence. The number is arbitrary, you can choose your own sample size here if you want depending on what you want to study. Below we specify the commands for requesting data from the twitter API using our credentials. For the twitteR package the key objects should appear in your global environment. The retweet package will only show the token object and environment in the variables section.\ntweets \u0026lt;- search_tweets(\u0026quot;gender violence\u0026quot;, n = 5000, include_rts = FALSE ) The code from rtweet is pretty straightforward. It says we are looking for 5000 tweets which contain gender and violence anywhere in the tweets and we want our search results to be put in the object we have named tweets. The search_tweets() is the function which performs the job. The include_rts=FALSE bit means we don’t want retweets to be included in our search. Specifying the same query in the twitteR package, our code would look like the following. Not so different: We want 5000 tweets containing the words gender and violence of any language and we want them put in the tweets object. Note that here we have not told the twitter API to exclude retweets.\ntweets \u0026lt;- searchTwitter(\u0026quot;gender+violence\u0026quot;, n=5000, lang=NULL) We should now have our data and the next job, which should be the subject of my next post, is to manipulate it so that it can be ready to be used in quantitative text analysis. But before we go, I want to introduce another platform, which you can use to mine twitter data, especially for those who get a little bogged down by programming stuff. It has search and visualisation capabilities built within it. It is called COSMOS, developed by the social data science lab at Cardiff University. It is free for academic institutions and not-for-profit organisations. The interface looks as follows and you will find demos on the website on how to collect and analyse the data. It is pretty straight forward and I highly recommend it.\nCosmos interface.\n ","date":1560996794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560996794,"objectID":"3470199fe17a7826006d224e6992bc61","permalink":"/post/twitter_data/","publishdate":"2019-06-19T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/twitter_data/","section":"post","summary":"In this post, I document the process and tools used to acquire data from the Twitter API.

However, in sub-Saharan Africa and other patriarchal societies, pregnancy and childbirth are still seen as a feminine matter and male participation is subject to social stigma and sanctions. Recognising the global health promotion of male involvement in maternal health as a strategy to ensure safer pregnancy and childbirth, this paper seeks to understand the process of attitude change from patriarchal attitudes which characterises male involvement in maternal healthcare as a feminine matter because of traditional gender division of labour to more egalitarian ones which support participation. Male involvement in maternal healthcare being a macro phenomena is embedded within the social and cultural fabric of society. Understanding micro-level actions which brings it about is important because it helps us identify conditions under which men are enabled to participate in maternal healthcare which subsequently has the potential of enhancing policy strategies in the positive direction. The paper operationalises the social influence theory and applies it to patriarchal societies of sub-Saharan Africa. I use agent-based modelling to simulate an artificial society and the idea of the model is to simulate the decision-making process of agents living in a social environment which is predominated by patriarchal and masculinity ideologies and experiencing some change due to persuasive communications from social networks, interest organisations, opinion leaders and significant others to change traditional attitudes and behaviours towards egalitarianism and participate in maternal healthcare. The results show that attitudinal ahnage was a function of the number of people propagating a particular attitudinal change, the extent of their influence and their closeness to the individual with opposing attitudes. The results also show a familiar trend in attitudinal change research and the complex phenomena of polarisation in society--that if in general, social interaction resulted into the attitude of the majority becoming dominant, complete uniformity of attitudes was never attained and clustering along like-minded attitudes was observed. The study illuminates the need for advocates of male involvement in maternal healthcare in patriarchal societies to maximize their outreach and target opinion leaders who are likely to have a big impact in changing attitudes from patriarchal to egalitarian ones","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Male Participation in Maternal Healthcare in a Patriarchal Population: An Agent-Based Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My PhD research focusses on structural violence and (in)equities in maternal healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa.

But before anyone mistakes me for a coder or a computer science nerd, I wanted say that I didn’t build this website from ground-up. I made it in RStudio, an open-source integrated development environment for R, using the blogdown package. I am still rusty in html, CSS and JavaScript, which are the languages you would need to master to be able to build your own website. I had this website up and running without knowing any code at all. When I return, I will provide detailed instructions on how I did it. But if you can’t buy my procastinations, I think I have enough time to point you to the wonderful resources that helped me in this process and if you follow them, you will be good to create your own website without my further assistance. The first place to start from is ofcourse familiarising yourself with RStudio and the blogdown package which you can read in the blogdown book. You can buy the book if you want but it is also available for free online on that link I have provided. I guess the choice there is pretty obvious for most people. The blogdown package uses Hugo as the website generator. Hugo has plenty of themes, which are basically your website designs. You can choose your prefered theme. I have used the academic theme because as you can tell, it is more suitable for academics and I happen to be one.\nThe blogdown book is very good but it might not be enough for you, depending on your mirage. You could complement it with a few other online resources. I found write-ups by the co-authors of the book to be very helpful. Yihui Xie is reponsible for the creation of the blogdown package. So, this one you have to know and probably follow on Twitter or anywhere you can find him in online platforms. The answers he gives to questions he is asked on Stack Overflow, github or his own website could serve you long hours of nightmares. Amber Thomas’s blog post about Making a website using R Markdown and Alison Presmanes Hill’s talk on Up \u0026amp; Running with blogdown are equally nuggets of gold. Check them out. They also provide links on other resources you might need, again depending on your mirage. Git, Githup and netlify are other platforms they will say you need to be familiar with.\nOther than that I will recommend that you watch three videos on YouTube. The first is by Yihui, whom I have introduced earlier. He pretty much explains the blogdown package in a one hour video. You can find it here. The second is done by Daniel Quintana. He will show you how to actually setup your website, make changes to the default files and personalise your website. Find the video here. Finally John Muschelli here. He casually goes through the deployment process, which you will find very useful because he also explains how to include domain names and attaching files to your website. That’s all I did for this website to be up. The only other thing you will need is your intuition and a bit of common sense, then you will be good to go.\n ","date":1551924794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551924794,"objectID":"e591a1cf48224d14b68794c5e1c25875","permalink":"/post/creating-website/","publishdate":"2019-03-06T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/creating-website/","section":"post","summary":"Building a website I will come back to this post later to finish it up.

We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled male truck drivers at trucking companies in Lusaka, Zambia. Findings indicate that truck drivers experience multiple stressors and potentially traumatic incidences, including delays and long waiting hours at borders, exposure to crime and violence, poverty, stress related to resisting temptation of sexual interactions with sex workers or migrant women, and job-related safety concerns. Multiple psychosocial problems such as intimate partner violence, loneliness, anxiety and depression-like symptoms were noted. Transactional sex, coupled with inconsistent condom use, were identified as HIV sexual risk behaviours. Findings suggest the critical need to develop HIV-prevention interventions which account for mobility, potentially traumatic events, psychosocial problems, and the extreme fear of HIV testing among this key population.","tags":[],"title":"A Qualitative study of migrant-related stressors, Psychological outcomes and HIV risk behaviour among truck drivers in Zambia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ntalasha H","Malungo JRS","Merten S","Simona JS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"a9dccca82aa4324cc77b25c9beba37ab","permalink":"/publication/food-sup/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/food-sup/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: There is a serious dearth of literature, particularly on Zambia, on the influential role of food supplements on people’s decision to take up an HIV test, start and adhere to AIDS treatment.

Results: Findings show that people who felt food insecure were reluctant to go for a test, thereby not accessing treatment and care services. The narratives revealed numerous aspects of food supplements, HIV testing, ART uptake and adherence, including desire to have access to food due to food insecurity, hoping and wishing to be found positive to access food, envying the HIV positive accessing food, desiring to have physical transformation and healthy-looking bodies enabled by increased access to food, reluctance and avoidance of taking the drugs without food, and worries about food once on medication. Conclusion: The study has shown a close link between food supplements, willingness to test, start taking medication and adherence. Therefore, food supplements should be made an integral part of HIV and AIDS related services in resource poor settings. This means devising more sustainable cross-sectional approaches to foster food security and general livelihoods, such as initiation of income generating activities among vulnerable rural poor, particularly those living with HIV and AIDS","tags":[],"title":"Influence of food supplements on test- ing for HIV and AIDS and adhering to treatment in a resource poor rural setting: A case of Chivuna, Southern Zambia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
