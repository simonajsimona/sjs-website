But before anyone mistakes me for a coder or a computer science nerd, I wanted say that I didn’t build this website from ground-up. I made it in RStudio, an open-source integrated development environment for R, using the blogdown package. I am still rusty in html, CSS and JavaScript, which are the languages you would need to master to be able to build your own website. I had this website up and running without knowing any code at all. When I return, I will provide detailed instructions on how I did it. But if you can’t buy my procastinations, I think I have enough time to point you to the wonderful resources that helped me in this process and if you follow them, you will be good to create your own website without my further assistance. The first place to start from is ofcourse familiarising yourself with RStudio and the blogdown package which you can read in the blogdown book. You can buy the book if you want but it is also available for free online on that link I have provided. I guess the choice there is pretty obvious for most people. The blogdown package uses Hugo as the website generator. Hugo has plenty of themes, which are basically your website designs. You can choose your prefered theme. I have used the academic theme because as you can tell, it is more suitable for academics and I happen to be one.\nThe blogdown book is very good but it might not be enough for you, depending on your mirage. You could complement it with a few other online resources. I found write-ups by the co-authors of the book to be very helpful. Yihui Xie is reponsible for the creation of the blogdown package. So, this one you have to know and probably follow on Twitter or anywhere you can find him in online platforms. The answers he gives to questions he is asked on Stack Overflow, github or his own website could serve you long hours of nightmares. Amber Thomas’s blog post about Making a website using R Markdown and Alison Presmanes Hill’s talk on Up \u0026amp; Running with blogdown are equally nuggets of gold. Check them out. They also provide links on other resources you might need, again depending on your mirage. Git, Githup and netlify are other platforms they will say you need to be familiar with.\nOther than that I will recommend that you watch three videos on YouTube. The first is by Yihui, whom I have introduced earlier. He pretty much explains the blogdown package in a one hour video. You can find it here. The second is done by Daniel Quintana. He will show you how to actually setup your website, make changes to the default files and personalise your website. Find the video here. Finally John Muschelli here. He casually goes through the deployment process, which you will find very useful because he also explains how to include domain names and attaching files to your website. That’s all I did for this website to be up. The only other thing you will need is your intuition and a bit of common sense, then you will be good to go.\n ","date":1551924794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551924794,"objectID":"e591a1cf48224d14b68794c5e1c25875","permalink":"/post/creating-website/","publishdate":"2019-03-06T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/creating-website/","section":"post","summary":"Building a website I will come back to this post later to finish it up.

The findings indicate that women’s characteristics including marital status, household wealth, witnessing parental violence and attitudes justifying wife beating were significantly associated with reporting experience of IPV. Partner characteristics significantly associated with IPV were alcohol consumption and jealous behaviour. In this study, IPV was not found to be strongly associated with use of maternal health care. The study indicates that gender inequality and problematic cultural norms that privilege men with power over women still exist in Zambia, and thus IPV preventive strategies should incorporate means of toning down such norms to enhance the welfare of women.","tags":[],"title":"Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) In Zambia: Sociodemographic Characteristics and Use of Maternal Healthcare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michalopolous LT","Baca-Atlas S","Simona JS","Jiwatram-Negron, T","Ncube, A","Chery, MB"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488844800,"objectID":"6f301c0c1a325141d3b0c2f024a41791","permalink":"/publication/risk-behaviour/","publishdate":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/risk-behaviour/","section":"publication","summary":"In Western settings, the relationship between trauma history, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use, and HIV risk behavior, is well established.

R is a statistical programming language and computing environment that has become a lingua franca for the statistical community worldwide and it is increasingly becoming prominent in the social sciences too. Investing time in learning and understanding how R works brings huge benefits to researchers. It allows us to perform almost any statistical analysis from the most basic to the most advanced; It offers user flexibility to create and incorporate external packages to produce unique solutions to complex problems; it has become one of the best platforms to produce powerful data graphics; it makes it easy to transition to other object-oriented programming languages if one desires and it is FREE. The development of R Markdown available through RStudio has made it even more valuable. R Markdown offers a comprehensive ecosystem for authoring documents as it enables researchers to combine the statistical and text aspects of their projects to produce beautifully looking documents in form of reports, journal articles, books, blog posts, presentations and interactive applications. R Markdown documments can be compiled to multiple types of output formats including LaTeX, HTML and Word.
