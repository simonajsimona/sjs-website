But before anyone mistakes me for a coder or a computer science nerd, I wanted say that I didn’t build this website from ground-up. I made it in RStudio, an open-source integrated development environment for R, using the blogdown package. I am still rusty in html, CSS and JavaScript, which are the languages you would need to master to be able to build your own website. I had this website up and running without knowing any code at all. When I return, I will provide detailed instructions on how I did it. But if you can’t buy my procastinations, I think I have enough time to point you to the wonderful resources that helped me in this process and if you follow them, you will be good to create your own website without my further assistance. The first place to start from is ofcourse familiarising yourself with RStudio and the blogdown package which you can read in the blogdown book. You can buy the book if you want but it is also available for free online on that link I have provided. I guess the choice there is pretty obvious for most people. The blogdown package uses Hugo as the website generator. Hugo has plenty of themes, which are basically your website designs. You can choose your prefered theme. I have used the academic theme because as you can tell, it is more suitable for academics and I happen to be one.\nThe blogdown book is very good but it might not be enough for you, depending on your mirage. You could complement it with a few other online resources. I found write-ups by the co-authors of the book to be very helpful. Yihui Xie is reponsible for the creation of the blogdown package. So, this one you have to know and probably follow on Twitter or anywhere you can find him in online platforms. The answers he gives to questions he is asked on Stack Overflow, github or his own website could serve you long hours of nightmares. Amber Thomas’s blog post about Making a website using R Markdown and Alison Presmanes Hill’s talk on Up \u0026amp; Running with blogdown are equally nuggets of gold. Check them out. They also provide links on other resources you might need, again depending on your mirage. Git, Githup and netlify are other platforms they will say you need to be familiar with.\nOther than that I will recommend that you watch three videos on YouTube. The first is by Yihui, whom I have introduced earlier. He pretty much explains the blogdown package in a one hour video. You can find it here. The second is done by Daniel Quintana. He will show you how to actually setup your website, make changes to the default files and personalise your website. Find the video here. Finally John Muschelli here. He casually goes through the deployment process, which you will find very useful because he also explains how to include domain names and attaching files to your website. That’s all I did for this website to be up. The only other thing you will need is your intuition and a bit of common sense, then you will be good to go.\n ","date":1551924794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551924794,"objectID":"e591a1cf48224d14b68794c5e1c25875","permalink":"/post/creating-website/","publishdate":"2019-03-06T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/creating-website/","section":"post","summary":"Building a website I will come back to this post later to finish it up.

The findings indicate that women’s characteristics including marital status, household wealth, witnessing parental violence and attitudes justifying wife beating were significantly associated with reporting experience of IPV. Partner characteristics significantly associated with IPV were alcohol consumption and jealous behaviour. In this study, IPV was not found to be strongly associated with use of maternal health care. The study indicates that gender inequality and problematic cultural norms that privilege men with power over women still exist in Zambia, and thus IPV preventive strategies should incorporate means of toning down such norms to enhance the welfare of women.","tags":[],"title":"Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) In Zambia: Sociodemographic Characteristics and Use of Maternal Healthcare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michalopolous LT","Baca-Atlas S","Simona JS","Jiwatram-Negron, T","Ncube, A","Chery, MB"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488844800,"objectID":"6f301c0c1a325141d3b0c2f024a41791","permalink":"/publication/risk-behaviour/","publishdate":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/risk-behaviour/","section":"publication","summary":"In Western settings, the relationship between trauma history, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use, and HIV risk behavior, is well established.

R is a statistical programming language and computing environment that has become a lingua franca for the statistical community worldwide and it is increasingly becoming prominent in the social sciences too. Investing time in learning and understanding how R works brings huge benefits to researchers. It allows us to perform almost any statistical analysis from the most basic to the most advanced; It offers user flexibility to create and incorporate external packages to produce unique solutions to complex problems; it has become one of the best platforms to produce powerful data graphics; it makes it easy to transition to other object-oriented programming languages if one desires and it is FREE. The development of R Markdown available through RStudio has made it even more valuable. R Markdown offers a comprehensive ecosystem for authoring documents as it enables researchers to combine the statistical and text aspects of their projects to produce beautifully looking documents in form of reports, journal articles, books, blog posts, presentations and interactive applications. R Markdown documments can be compiled to multiple types of output formats including LaTeX, HTML and Word.

This study was aimed at: (1) determining potentially traumatic events (PTEs), labour migrant-related stressors, psychosocial problems and HIV risk behaviours among truck drivers in Zambia; and (2) examining the relationship between PTEs, migrant-related stressors, psychosocial outcomes and HIV sexual risk behaviour among truck drivers in Zambia. We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled male truck drivers at trucking companies in Lusaka, Zambia. Findings indicate that truck drivers experience multiple stressors and potentially traumatic incidences, including delays and long waiting hours at borders, exposure to crime and violence, poverty, stress related to resisting temptation of sexual interactions with sex workers or migrant women, and job-related safety concerns. Multiple psychosocial problems such as intimate partner violence, loneliness, anxiety and depression-like symptoms were noted. Transactional sex, coupled with inconsistent condom use, were identified as HIV sexual risk behaviours. Findings suggest the critical need to develop HIV-prevention interventions which account for mobility, potentially traumatic events, psychosocial problems, and the extreme fear of HIV testing among this key population.","tags":[],"title":"A Qualitative study of migrant-related stressors, Psychological outcomes and HIV risk behaviour among truck drivers in Zambia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ntalasha H","Malungo JRS","Merten S","Simona JS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"a9dccca82aa4324cc77b25c9beba37ab","permalink":"/publication/food-sup/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/food-sup/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: There is a serious dearth of literature, particularly on Zambia, on the influential role of food supplements on people’s decision to take up an HIV test, start and adhere to AIDS treatment. Methods: Using data from a large ethnographic qualitative study in a resource poor rural setting in Zambia, this paper examines and documents the critical role of food supplements in influencing people to go for HIV testing, initiate treatment and stick to it. Results: Findings show that people who felt food insecure were reluctant to go for a test, thereby not accessing treatment and care services. The narratives revealed numerous aspects of food supplements, HIV testing, ART uptake and adherence, including desire to have access to food due to food insecurity, hoping and wishing to be found positive to access food, envying the HIV positive accessing food, desiring to have physical transformation and healthy-looking bodies enabled by increased access to food, reluctance and avoidance of taking the drugs without food, and worries about food once on medication. Conclusion: The study has shown a close link between food supplements, willingness to test, start taking medication and adherence. Therefore, food supplements should be made an integral part of HIV and AIDS related services in resource poor settings. This means devising more sustainable cross-sectional approaches to foster food security and general livelihoods, such as initiation of income generating activities among vulnerable rural poor, particularly those living with HIV and AIDS","tags":[],"title":"Influence of food supplements on test- ing for HIV and AIDS and adhering to treatment in a resource poor rural setting: A case of Chivuna, Southern Zambia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
