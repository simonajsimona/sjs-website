      <description>Building a website I will come back to this post later to finish it up. But before anyone mistakes me for a coder or a computer science nerd, I wanted say that I didnâ€™t build this website from ground-up. I made it in RStudio, an open-source integrated development environment for R, using the blogdown package. I am still rusty in html, CSS and JavaScript, which are the languages you would need to master to be able to build your own website.</description>
