      <description>In this post, I document the process and tools used to acquire data from the Twitter API. I will use the R statistical programming language through RStudio in this process. It is important that you install R and RStudio on your machine, including all the accompanying packages specified here. Get documentation providing installation guides for both R and RStudio here. We are going to use the RStudio environment for our data collection but of course it will not work properly if you haven’t installed R first as he installation document explains.</description>

      <description>Building a website I will come back to this post later to finish it up. But before anyone mistakes me for a coder or a computer science nerd, I wanted say that I didn’t build this website from ground-up. I made it in RStudio, an open-source integrated development environment for R, using the blogdown package. I am still rusty in html, CSS and JavaScript, which are the languages you would need to master to be able to build your own website.</description>
