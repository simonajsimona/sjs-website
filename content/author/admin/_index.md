I am a PhD student at the University of Glasgow studying Sociology and Quantitative Social Science Methods. Using advanced multlevel models, I study structural sources of disparities in health and health care outcomes in low and middle-income countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa. I am also interested in the concept of emergence and how emergent properties develop in the social system. This means both bottom-up and top-down approaches to studying social phenomena are appealing to me. It also means I have wide ranging interests, from Philosophy of Science to Computational Social Science, including everything in between.
