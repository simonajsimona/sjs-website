# Abstract.
abstract = "Maternal health care utilisation still remains crucial in ensuring good pregnancy outcomes and a reduction in maternal mortality and child mortality especially in developing countries. Although several studies have been conducted investigate determinants of maternal health care utilisation, the multi-country and multi-level influence of socio-cultural factors on use of maternal health care has received little attention. This paper sets out to examine the influence of gender relations and female empowerment on maternal healthcare utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis pools sample data of 245,955 respondents from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys and World Development Indicators of 35 sub-Saharan African countries. Separate Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models are fitted for adequate antinatal care, institutional delivery and postnatal care in relation to several factors indicating gender relations and female empowerment as three levels. Fixed and random effects were produced. At the individual level, adjusted results indicate that women who have attained at least primary education, are in the second and higher wealth quintile, are employed, exercise sexual autonomy and have insurance coverage are more like to use maternal health care. Urban residence, living in areas that are proximal to health facilities, have more educated women, have more women with decision-making authority and less polynous marriages enhances the propensity to consistently use maternal health care. These results help to underscore the importance of contextual factors in understanding womenâ€™s utilisation of maternal healthcare and how critical they are in the implementation of policy strategies aimed at bolstering maternal healthcare uptake in low resource countries."
