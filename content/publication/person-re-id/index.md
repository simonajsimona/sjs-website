# Abstract.
abstract = "This study used the 2013-2014 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) data to examine, on one hand, the socio-demographic characteristics associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) and, on the other hand, the relationship between IPV and maternal health care (place of delivery and ANC visits) utilization. The findings indicate that womenâ€™s characteristics including marital status, household wealth, witnessing parental violence and attitudes justifying wife beating were significantly associated with reporting experience of IPV. Partner characteristics significantly associated with IPV were alcohol consumption and jealous behaviour. In this study, IPV was not found to be strongly associated with use of maternal health care. The study indicates that gender inequality and problematic cultural norms that privilege men with power over women still exist in Zambia, and thus IPV preventive strategies should incorporate means of toning down such norms to enhance the welfare of women."
