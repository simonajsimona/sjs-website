# Abstract.
abstract = "Evidence shows that male participation is an important factor in enhancing maternal healthcare utilisation and good maternal health outcomes. However, in sub-Saharan Africa and other patriarchal societies, pregnancy and childbirth are still seen as a feminine matter and male participation is subject to social stigma and sanctions. Recognising the global health promotion of male involvement in maternal health as a strategy to ensure safer pregnancy and childbirth, this paper seeks to understand the process of attitude change from patriarchal attitudes which characterises male involvement in maternal healthcare as a feminine matter because of traditional gender division of labour to more egalitarian ones which support participation. Male involvement in maternal healthcare being a macro phenomena is embedded within the social and cultural fabric of society. Understanding micro-level actions which brings it about is important because it helps us identify conditions under which men are enabled to participate in maternal healthcare which subsequently has the potential of enhancing policy strategies in the positive direction. The paper operationalises the social influence theory and applies it to patriarchal societies of sub-Saharan Africa. I use agent-based modelling to simulate an artificial society and the idea of the model is to simulate the decision-making process of agents living in a social environment which is predominated by patriarchal and masculinity ideologies and experiencing some change due to persuasive communications from social networks, interest organisations, opinion leaders and significant others to change traditional attitudes and behaviours towards egalitarianism and participate in maternal healthcare. The results show that attitudinal ahnage was a function of the number of people propagating a particular attitudinal change, the extent of their influence and their closeness to the individual with opposing attitudes. The results also show a familiar trend in attitudinal change research and the complex phenomena of polarisation in society--that if in general, social interaction resulted into the attitude of the majority becoming dominant, complete uniformity of attitudes was never attained and clustering along like-minded attitudes was observed. The study illuminates the need for advocates of male involvement in maternal healthcare in patriarchal societies to maximize their outreach and target opinion leaders who are likely to have a big impact in changing attitudes from patriarchal to egalitarian ones"
