# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "R is a statistical programming language and computing environment which is prominent in the statistical community worldwide and is increasingly becoming popular in the social sciences. It is free, open source, performs almost any statistical analysis, produces powerful data graphics and it is extensible. Freely available adds-on R packages enhance its capability not only for data analysis and graphics but also for combining statistical and text components of the research project to create beautifully looking research reports, journal articles, books, blog posts and presentations. Yes! It is true to say that R can come in quite handy in the job market. This session introduces participants to R both for statistical and non-statistical purposes. It prepares participants for more advanced courses either in this summer school or elsewhere. Outline and materials [here](https://simonajsimona.com/tutorial/sgss-summer/)"
