Before the workshop begins, make you have downloaded and installed R on your machine. I have written a document containing instructions about downloading and installing R. Find it [here](https://simonajsimona.com/R-Studio_Environment.pdf) if you need it. It also has basic R commands. The workshop schedule is [here](https://simonajsimona.com/training/unza-r-workshp.doc)

The folder containing lab handouts and datasets should be downloaded from here
