My PhD research focusses on structural violence and (in)equities in maternal healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. It is aimed at understanding the hierarchical and multiple-level social structure in which individual persons are nested and how these structures interact together to determine maternal healthcare disparities. I use the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the World Development Indicators (WDI) as primary data sources in my study. I have merged DHS and WDI data from 35 sub-Saharan African countries and I mainly apply Bayesian mixed effects models.
